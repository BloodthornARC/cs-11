Today, i learned some new hotkeys on keyboard, for browser and for the basic systyem business
I havent shown those hotkeys that i know, but i dont think this is a big problem
I finaly got onto some details about working with git hub, now this is easier and faster for me
We got a website for training fast typing, and that`s cool
We got teacher mad today, because of some not very tollerant persons in our class. Very very sorry
After all, Im proud of myself, for learning something new today.
